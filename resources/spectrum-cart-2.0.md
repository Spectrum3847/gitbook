# Spectrum Cart 2.0

We’ve been using a version of this cart since 2021-2022. We have two of them now, and are likely making a third soon.

### Features <a href="#p-3448066-features-3" id="p-3448066-features-3"></a>

* **Small footprint:** at 2ft x 3ft, it is legal to go onto the field if needed.
* **Adjustable:** can easily change the height of the robot for tall robots, etc. We screw in 2 4x4 wood blocks to the top rails to place the robot on; this supports it well and doesn’t scratch the belly pan much.
* **Swerve Access:** The cart doesn’t have a top deck so we can easily work on our swerve modules under our robot while it is is on the cart. Wheel swaps, cleaning, etc are very easy.
* **Collapsible:** By removing a few bolts, the robot rails can be removed and the handle can fold down. This made it easy for us to ship it with our robot and pit supplies to Chezy Champs in 2023. Can also fit in most car trunks.
* **Customizable:** Can easily mount other accessories to the cart. We have made mounts to attach our driver station to the handle side. We have thought about others such as water bottle holders, etc. but haven’t made them.
* **Common FRC Build Materials and Practices:** uses the same techniques, materials, and fasteners that we use to build our robots.
* **Bottom shelf with lip:** The rail on the bottom shelf prevents items from rolling off; we can have bolts and tools down there without them falling off as we move.

### Materials <a href="#p-3448066-materials-5" id="p-3448066-materials-5"></a>

* **1x1 Square Extrusion:** can use pre-punched or regular and add a few holes. We have used REV 1x1 for both our carts. (#TeamREV)
* **90 degree and T gussets:** can use any vendor or custom make them. Can use 90s for all of them if you want.
* **⅜” or ½” Plywood base:** Simple rectangle cut out with some holes for the casters.
* **⅞” Round tube:** for the handle with star nuts pressed in. Could use more square tube but it’s not as comfortable to push/pull.
* **4x swivel+locking casters:** Having all 4 wheels swivel and brake is pretty convenient for sliding through narrow pits, etc. The 5” wheels are a good compromise on size. We prefer solid wheels to pneumatic so we never have to deal with flats or blow outs. We bolt them on with 10-32 hardware and washers so that we always have easy access to those tools or spare hardware if needed. These are similar to what we use - [Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3YLjnjT)
