# 2025 TRI Rule Changes

Texas Robotics Invitational 2025 will use the FRC 2025 Reefscape rules except where noted below. Please send any questions to [TRI@Spectrum3847.org](mailto:TRI@Spectrum3847.org).

## 1. Event Rule Changes

#### E108 \*Some things don’t belong at events. Do not bring or use the following:

A. skateboards\
B. ‘hoverboards’\
C. drones\
D. bottled gas tanks (e.g. helium)\
E. noisy devices or noisemakers, such as floor stompers, whistles and/or air horns\
F. walkie-talkies\
G. scooters, except for those used for accommodations\
<mark style="background-color:yellow;">H. Full Face Mascots</mark>

{% hint style="danger" %}
Violation: Team Members will be asked to remove them from the Venue, Further Violations can result in G201 Violations, Red Cards, Disqualification, and / or Team Memebrs will be asked to leave the venue.
{% endhint %}

***

#### E406 \*No Tall Ladders allowed

No Ladders with more than 3 steps or taller than 5ft are allowed to be used by team at any point for any reason at the Event.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a new rule for TRI. Using tall ladders is an unecessary safety risk especially with the density of people at an FRC Competition.
{% endhint %}

***

#### E802 ~~\*Pit person limit during Ceremonies is 5~~

~~No more than 5 team members may be in the pits during Ceremonies outside of Playoff MATCHES.~~

{% hint style="info" %}
This rule is never enforced, and so shouldn't be in the rules
{% endhint %}

***

## 2. Field Marking Changes

There is now a PROCESSOR PATHWAY that connects an alliance’s PROCESSOR AREA and ALLIANCE AREA Marked by a 2” Gaffers tape line.  Only HUMAN PLAYERS may use this pathway and must make a reasonable effort to stay on the line when moving between the 2 zones.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

***

## 3. Driveteams

#### 6.2 DRIVE TEAM

A DRIVE TEAM is a set of up to 5 people from the same FIRST Robotics Competition team responsible for team performance for a specific MATCH. There are 4 specific roles on a DRIVE TEAM which ALLIANCES can use to assist ROBOTS with REEFSCAPE.

<table><thead><tr><th>Role</th><th>Description</th><th data-type="number">Max./ DRIVE TEAM</th><th>Criteria</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>COACH<br><br><br><br>TECHNICIAN</td><td>a guide or advisor</td><td>2</td><td>any team member, must wear “COACH”<br>button</td></tr><tr><td><p>DRIVER<br><br></p><p><br>HUMAN PLAYER</p></td><td><p>an operator and controller<br>of the ROBOT<br></p><p></p><p><br>a SCORING ELEMENT<br>manager</p></td><td>3</td><td>STUDENT, must wear a “DRIVE TEAM”<br>button</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
Combined TECHNICIAN and COACH count. A team may have up to 2 Coaches.
{% endhint %}

***

#### 6.3.1 DRIVETEAMS

DRIVE TEAMS prepare for a MATCH by staging in the appropriate areas, according to their role on the DRIVE TEAM, and by identifying themselves accordingly. DRIVE TEAM starting conditions are listed below, and a DRIVE TEAM obstructing or delaying any of the conditions is at risk of violating G301.&#x20;

* A. only DRIVE TEAM members assigned to the upcoming MATCH are present,&#x20;
* B. For QUALIFICATION and PLAYOFF MATCHES only DRIVE TEAM members whose ROBOTS have passed initial, complete Inspection are present,
* C. any number of HUMAN PLAYERS are staged in their CORAL STATION AREAS,
* D. HUMAN PLAYERS not included in C or D, DRIVERS, and COACHES are in their ALLIANCE AREA and behind the HUMAN STARTING LINE,&#x20;
* E. TECHNICIANS are in the event-designated area near the FIELD,
* F. DRIVE TEAM members clearly display their designated buttons above their waists (COACH - “Coach”, DRIVERS and HUMAN PLAYERS - “Drive Team”
* G. if a Playoff MATCH, the ALLIANCE CAPTAIN clearly displays their designated ALLIANCE CAPTAIN identifier (e.g. hat or armband).

{% hint style="info" %}
Requirement for HUMAN PLAYER to start in the PROCESSOR AREA has been removed.
{% endhint %}

***

## 4. Ranking Points

<table><thead><tr><th>Ranking Point</th><th>Requirements</th><th data-type="number">Ranking Points Awarded</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AUTO RP</td><td>all non-BYPASSED ROBOTS LEAVE and at least 1 CORAL scored<br>in AUTO</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CORAL RP</td><td>at least <mark style="background-color:yellow;">6</mark> CORAL must be scored on each of 3<br>levels.</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>BARGE RP</td><td>at least <mark style="background-color:yellow;">14</mark> BARGE points are scored</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Win</td><td>completing a MATCH with more MATCH points than your opponent</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Tie</td><td>completing a MATCH with the same number of MATCH points as your opponent</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

***

## 5. Coopertition Point&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Coopertition Point has been eliminated.
{% endhint %}

***

## 6. Game Rule Updates

{% hint style="info" %}
All Yellow and Red Cards are now at the discretion of the Head Referee. Minor non-match-affecting incidents will be given warnings before cards are given. Teams will not be punished for field staff giving them directions such as entering the field.
{% endhint %}

***

#### Q101. Be reasonable with the Head Referee.

Most situations will likely only require one or two people to talk with the Head Referee. Still, we aren't going to institute a rule that doesn’t allow other drive team members (including adult drive coaches) to provide information or listen to the conversations. Please be mindful that the Head Referee makes the final decision on calls but may be advised by other referees and the Event Director (who replaces HQ at off-season events). Also, please remember that G212 is a rule, and the Head referee may give YELLOW or RED CARDS for any interactions that are deemed to be egregious. We are all working for the inspiration of our students. Be polite, reasonable, and respectful; we will all have a great event.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The original Q101 causes more issues than it solves and is often not enforced to the letter of the rule. We trust our volunteers and teams to be reasonable and act in good faith to get the best outcome for everyone involved.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

***

#### G207 Don’t abuse ARENA access

A team member (except DRIVERS, HUMAN PLAYERS, and COACHES) granted access to restricted areas in and around the ARENA (e.g. via Media badges<mark style="background-color:yellow;">, Volunteer position,</mark> etc.) may not assist or use signaling devices during the MATCH. <mark style="background-color:yellow;">FIELD STAFF shall not communicate with TEAMS about rule violations or gameplay concerns during a MATCH. The only exceptions are for immediate safety issues or for FTAs, FTAAs, or CSAs diagnosing technical problems.</mark>

{% hint style="danger" %}
Violation: Verbal warning. Yellow Card for Subsequent Violations. <mark style="background-color:yellow;">ARENA FAULT if violated by Event Staff.</mark>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This rule is intended to prevent distractions during MATCH play, to prevent a DRIVE TEAM member from distracting a REFEREE, and to ensure consistent communication across all TEAMS and MATCHES. TEAMS may address any rule-related questions or concerns with the Head REFEREE once the MATCH has concluded. Violations by Event Staff associated with teams in that match with the intent to cause an arena fault will quickly escalate to a G211 violation.
{% endhint %}

***

#### G302. \*You can’t bring/use anything you want.

Clothes and shoes are okay, and backpacks and items in your pockets or backpacks are okay if they don’t violate the other rules stated in G302.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Violation: MATCH will not start until the situation is remedied. If discovered or used inappropriately during a MATCH , YELLOW CARD .
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Almost everyone has a phone in their pocket or bag and wears clothing, so it should be against the rules. You still can’t use your phone or radio to communicate with anyone during the match or any of the other violations, but it’s just weird that it’s not clear in the rules that it’s allowed.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

***

#### G404 .~~No throwing in AUTO.~~&#x20;

~~In AUTO, a HUMAN PLAYER may not enter ALGAE onto the field.~~

{% hint style="info" %}
Removing G404 removes an avenue for unintentional fouls that have no strategic gain. Removing this complexity is good for offseasons especially with rotating drive teams and new Human Players.\
\
If teams throw algae in an attempt to disrupt a teams auto it will be a G406 violation, and can quickly escalate to a G211 violation.
{% endhint %}

***

#### G422. \*Stay out of other ROBOTS.&#x20;

A ROBOT may not use a COMPONENT outside its FRAME PERIMETER (except its BUMPERS) to initiate <mark style="background-color:purple;">more than inconsequential</mark> contact with an opponent ROBOT inside the vertical projection of that opponent ROBOT’S FRAME PERIMETER.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Violation: MINOR FOUL
{% endhint %}

***

#### G423. \*This isn’t combat robotics.&#x20;

A ROBOT may not damage or functionally impair an opponent ROBOT in either of the following ways as a direct result of the contact:&#x20;

* **A.** deliberately, as perceived by a REFEREE.&#x20;
* **B.** regardless of intent, by initiating contact inside the vertical projection of an opponent ROBOT’S FRAME PERIMETER.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and YELLOW CARD. If opponent ROBOT is unable to drive <mark style="background-color:purple;">as a direct result of the contact</mark>, MAJOR FOUL, and RED CARD
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For G422 and G423, Robots attempting to “play the game” (score a game piece, move in the direction of one of their protected zones, etc.) will get the benefit of the doubt. In cases where referees are forced to make a judgment call regarding a destructive interaction between robots or an interaction that results in a questionable rules violation, the referees will err on the side of robots attempting to “play the game" <mark style="background-color:yellow;">regardless of the side of the field the interaction occurs.</mark>
{% endhint %}

***

#### G426. COACHES and other teams: hands off the controls.&#x20;

A ROBOT shall be operated solely by that team's DRIVERS and/or HUMAN PLAYERS.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Violation: MAJOR FOUL and Warning. Repeated/Extended: MAJOR FOUL and RED CARD.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Coaches may touch the driver station laptop to diagnose a problem with the robot but may not directly contact any controllers or operate the robot in any way.
{% endhint %}

***

## 7. Inspection Rules

&#x20;+5 pounds weight allowance and no formal inspections.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This allows repairs and minor modifications without major work to maintain 115 lbs. Robots may weigh up to 120 lbs. We also won’t have inspections at this event; event staff may ask you to make modifications if your robot doesn’t meet the FRC robot rules.
{% endhint %}

***

## 8. Alliance Selection

1. If we have more than 32 teams, The standard championship subdivision-level alliance selection process, including the four robots per alliance rules outlined in the game manual, will be used. 1-8, 8-1, 1-8
2. If we have fewer than 32 teams. We will use the standard 3-team alliance format from district/regional events.
3. At the beginning of Alliance Selection, the Emcee will ask if any teams would like to withdraw from Alliance Selection. Any teams wishing not to play can withdraw at this time. After Alliance #8 has made its first pick, teams are no longer allowed to decline invitations, and all further picks will be automatically accepted.

***

## 9. Video Review

Given that the technology allows it (the video system doesn’t go down, etc.), there will be a video review process.

* Each Alliance is allowed one challenge/review in the playoffs. The alliance captain will be provided a video review coupon.
* Video review coupons must be given to the head ref within 2 minutes after scores are posted for that match to be reviewed.
* Only match-affecting calls and yellow/red cards can be reviewed.&#x20;
* The score or lack of score being reviewed must be significant enough to affect the match's outcome. The Head Referee can choose not to review any call they do not believe will change the match's outcome.
* Video evidence must be indisputable to change a call. The point is to receive credit for a missed score, not to debate further a close call on which a referee already used their best judgment. The Head Referee's decision is final after a review.
* Only the head referee will use the event-provided video during a video review. Referees will not review any other video footage, including camcorders, phones, or tablets not provided by the event.
* At their discretion, the Head Referee may choose to review any ruling throughout the event. Please do not ask for a video review at any time other than giving the referee your alliance’s video review coupon during the playoffs. All other requests will not be granted.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
We don’t plan on ever having this happen, but we want to provide the best event possible to teams; a video review of other situations may allow us to do this.
{% endhint %}

***

## 10. Soft Time Cap

We will institute a soft time cap during the event to allow teams to leave in a reasonable amount of time if there are match delays. At the discretion of the event organizers, if the Finals start after 6 p.m. Central Time, we will move to a “Best of 1” elimination format instead of the usual “Best 2 of 3” format.&#x20;

***

## 11. Break Changes

Due to the lack of awards, all pre-scheduled breaks in Elims have been reduced to 8 minutes long. This is to speed up the process.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;This Rule isn’t meant to rush teams with a broken robot on the field. If you need the full break, the full break will be given.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
