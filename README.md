## Our Story

Spectrum evolved out of two determined teams and copious amounts of determination. We were originally the rival engineering teams of St. Agnes Academy, an all-girls school, and Strake Jesuit College Preparatory, an all-boys school. The St. Agnes Engineering Team began in 1993, participating in various competitions, while the Strake Jesuit Engineering Team began in 2008. After competing against each other for three years in the BEST competition, we were interested in undertaking a new challenge that would test our ability to the extreme.

The students met to discuss the future of such a program individually and began discussing the possibility of creating a joint FIRST Robotics Competition Team, which we knew would be a huge undertaking. However, we also knew that joining forces would provide an opportunity to create a team stronger than St. Agnes or Strake Jesuit could create separately. With our shared passion for robotics, we resolved our differences and began to coordinate our actions together on our first team challenge: garnering the support of sponsors and our school administrators. The joining of the two teams is a major part of Spectrum's history and defines us as a team that is willing and able to overcome any obstacle by using the many talents that each member brings.

## Mission Statement

Spectrum’s mission is to create and cultivate opportunities in which students are able to grow mentally and realize their true potential. Our students develop life skills through the promotion of premier qualities, such as amity, volunteerism, dedication, and ebullience. As an engineering team, we believe that every team member has a special place in the process and creation of our robots. We endorse team unity and bonding through integrity, confidence, and chivalry. Our team deepens the bonds between students by allowing them to interact in a safe and nurturing environment that promotes an exploration of ingenuity. We hope to facilitate a love of individuality through the appreciation of the students' varying abilities and qualities.
